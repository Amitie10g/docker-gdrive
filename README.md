This is a fork of [Matt Bailey's](https://github.com/mattbailey) **[docker-gdrive](https://github.com/mattbailey/docker-gdrive)** image, based on the [Alessandro Strada's](https://github.com/astrada/google-drive-ocamlfuse) [google-drive-ocamlfuse](https://github.com/astrada/google-drive-ocamlfuse) project, with few modifications to solve some problems when Client ID is not provided and providing up to date image.
